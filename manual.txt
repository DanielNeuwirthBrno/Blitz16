 
 GAME DESCRIPTION:
 -----------------
 
 A plane moves across the screen at a steady speed. When the plane reaches the end of the screen it moves to the other side and drops down one line, with the speed increasing each time the plane drops a line.
 
 Below is a cityscape composed of blocks. The player has to drop bombs from the plane, and each bomb which hits a building removes one block.
 
 As the plane descends it risks hitting any remaining blocks so priority has to be given to bombing the tallest "buildings". The game is completed when all blocks are removed.
